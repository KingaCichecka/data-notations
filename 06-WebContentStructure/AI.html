    <h1>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h1>
    
    <h2>AI Definition</h2>
    
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development
       of  computer systems that can perform tasks typically
       requiring human intelligence. These tasks include
       problem-solving, understanding natural language,
       recognizing patterns, and making decisions.</p>
    <p>AI is a broad field that encompasses various subfields
     and techniques, such as machine learning, natural
     language processing, robotics, and computer vision.</p>

    <h2>Examples of AI in Daily Life</h2>
    <p>AI is used as voice assistants. Siri, Google Assistant,
     and Alexa use AI to understand and respond to voice
     commands. Platforms like Netflix and Amazon use AI to
     recommend products or shows based on your previous
     interactions. AI enables self-driving cars to navigate
     roads and make driving decisions.</p>
